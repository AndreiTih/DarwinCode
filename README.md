# DarwinCode
A repository for the darwin project where relevant models from Multibench are extracted.

Currently the models extracted are:

AVMNIST:
- MultibenchRoot/examples/multimedia/avmnist_cca.py

MIMIC:

This is mainly for the purpose of eventually having a separate code repository containing our model and nothing else.
